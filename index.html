        <h2 class="heading">Early Childhood</h2>
        <p>
          Naruto Uzimaki was an outcast. Everybody treated him differently, and
          that made him a troublemaker. He goofed around alot and was considered
          an outcast. There was a beast that destroyed the whole village that
          was sealed in him by the
          <a
            href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Minato_Namikaze"
            target="_blank"
            >Fourth Hokage</a
          >. This gives him special abilities like healing himself quicker than
          others. The beast is not what makes him strong though,
          <span class="strong">his desire to become hokage</span>, is what made
          him strong. He was the weakest when he was young, failed all the
          tests, and was the class clown. Now he's up to par with all the other
          ninjas because he worked hard for it.

      <section class="container">
        <h2 class="heading">Team Seven</h2>
        <p>
          Everybody was split into teams according to their grades. You had Ino,
          a girl who has a crush on Sasuke, Shikomaru, smartest character and
          plays ninja like it's chess, and chogi, a character that get made fun
          of because of his weight but is really strong, led by Asuma Sarutobi;
          then, you got Rock Lee, a guy that doesn't use his chakra, but is very
          fast and uses his
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taijutsu">Taijutsu</a>, Neji,
          who can attack people chakra points, and Tenten, led by Might Guy;
          Then you got Hinata, who is very shy, and has a crush on Naruto, Kiba,
          who travels with a dog companion, and Shino who fights with bugs, led
          by Kurenai Yuhi; and then you got Naruto, his rival/best friend
          Sasuke, and Sakura, another girl who also has a crush on Sasuke. Those
          three were led by Kakashi, the copycat ninja. Kakashi challenged them
          to get the bells hanging out of his pocket, and they all tried their
          best, but failed. It was so easy, that Kakashi challenged them while
          reading a book! The rule was that they had to do it before eating
          lunch or they will get tied up. Naruto later got tied up and was
          forbidden to eat food while the others were eating. Sasuke and Sakura
          felt bad and both of them offered a portion of their food. Kakashi
          came out of nowhere and told them surprisingly that they past for
          teamwork! Every shinobi should work as a team, and so their long
          journey begins.

        <h2 class="heading">Challenges he faced</h2>
        <p>
          He had some rivals, and hardships he faced.
          <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Orochimaru" target="_blank"
            >Orochimaru</a
          >
          was the main antagonist in his Childhood. He's the only immortal
          villain and his ultimate goal was to
          <span class="bold">learn every Jutsu</span>! He later assassinated the
          third hokage, but the hokage in return, sealed his hands, so he can't
          perform any hand jutsu! That doesn't stop Orochimaru from getting what
          he wants though. He later cursed Sasuke Uchiha knowing that he will
          want to reach out to him to get more power to kill his older brother,
          <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Itachi_Uchiha" target="_blank"
            >Itachi Uchiha</a
          >! Then Orochimaru will try to use his body for himself! Naruto also
          faced another rival that was like him, that also had a beast sealed in
          him,
          <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Gaara" target="_blank"
            >Gaara</a
          >. Gaara was the antagonist in Naruto early days, but he later changed
          and achieved his purpose of becoming
          <span class="strong">Kazekage of the Sand village</span>. Naruto also
          felt loneliness, Sakura thought Naruto was a nuisance, and Sasuke was
          always better and stronger than him. This just made Naruto keep
          pushing himself, and later, everybody started to believe in him!

        <h2 class="heading">Naruto vs Sasuke</h2>
        <p>
          The ultimate battle begins! Sasuke used Naruto as a best friend to
          later try to kill him! Sasuke followed his brother footsteps. They got
          a special power called the Sharingan which allows you to see what the
          human eye can't see. To unlock it's full potential, you must kill your
          loved one. When Naruto and Sasuke battled, Sasuke nearly kill Naruto,
          but decided not to. He wanted to try to find another way to achieve
          his power so he went on to train with Orochimaru.
